## Abstract
The developed project consists in the training of multiple Machine Learning
models, making them able to classify a bean into the variety to which it belongs
based on its characteristics, previously identified through a Computer Vision
model. In particular, an initial analysis of the dataset will be carried out,
with related PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
This first phase will be followed by the actual training of four classification
models: a decision tree, a neural network (more precisely a Multi Layer
Perceptron), a Support Vector Machine, and a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
Finally, the various models will be compared with suitable metrics, in order
to identify the one most suitable for the task of beans' classification.
